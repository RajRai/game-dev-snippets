# game-dev-snippets
Snippets from game development. Contains some WIP. Only contains classes I've created - not a comprehensive list of changes. Many things had to be written in less than ideal ways for compatibility with the decade-old system they're used in.

My best work is in the package [server.util](https://github.com/RajRai/game-dev-snippets/tree/master/src/server/util). That code is least constrained by the system it's working within.
